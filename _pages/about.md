I am Dr. Abhigna Bhatt, a passionate researcher and postdoctoral fellow specializing in wave propagation, metamaterials, and vibration isolation. My academic journey culminated with a PhD from IIT Delhi, where I developed analytical and experimental methods to understand and engineer wave dispersion in complex mechanical systems, including nonlinear and coupled metamaterials.

My research focuses on designing novel metamaterial structures that can control vibration and wave transmission, with applications spanning noise reduction, structural health monitoring, and advanced engineering materials. I have published extensively in leading journals such as *Journal of Sound and Vibration*, *Physical Review E*, and *Physics Letters A*, and have presented my work at international conferences including ECCOMAS and META.

In my work, I combine rigorous analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experimental validation to uncover new physical phenomena such as double attenuation peaks and relative resonance in mechanical systems. I am deeply motivated by the challenge of bridging theory and practice to develop solutions that can transform how we control vibrations and waves in engineering.

Beyond research, I am committed to advancing knowledge through collaboration and mentoring young researchers. Balancing a demanding research career with family life has strengthened my resilience, organization, and passion for continuous learning.

Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my projects, publications, and contributions to the field of mechanical metamaterials. I welcome opportunities for collaboration, discussion, and innovation.
